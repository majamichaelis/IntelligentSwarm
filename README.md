# Swarm (based on the Flocking Algorithm)
  <h2>Scenes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Scene (Normal)</li>
        <li>Scene (Job System with 1 Job)</li>
        <li>Scene (Job System with 2 Jobs)</li>
        <li>Scene (Burst Compiler)</li>
    </ul>

  <p>To use my swarm, the Unity Package should be imported, and the README file should be utilized!</p>

  <h2>Swarm Algorithm</h2>
    <p>A swarm algorithm has been implemented, which can be used flexibly. It was primarily implemented to simulate a fish swarm in a virtual reality underwater world. The goal was to create an intelligent swarm that is as performant as possible.</p>

  <p>I based my work on the three rules of the Flocking Algorithm (Koberger, 2012):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Rule of Separation:</strong> The swarm agents should avoid each other and never occupy the same position.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rule of Alignment:</strong> The swarm agents should move in the direction of their neighbors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rule of Cohesion:</strong> The direction determination should be based on the average direction of the neighbors in the swarm.
        </li>
    </ol>

  <p>Additionally, I included a target position. The swarm should move based on a target position, which can dynamically change, and based on the others in the swarm. Furthermore, it should be possible to avoid existing obstacles. Each swarm agent knows the position of all other swarm agents. However, not every swarm agent counts as a neighbor for my calculation, as it is possible to adjust the neighborhood distance, allowing different swarm groups to be created.</p>

  <h2>Job System and Burst Compiler</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Job System:</strong> The Unity Job System allows workloads to be divided into smaller, independent jobs that can be executed in parallel. This optimally utilizes multi-core processors and improves the overall performance of the application.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Burst Compiler:</strong> The Burst Compiler optimizes the machine code generated by the jobs for maximum efficiency. This leads to a significant performance boost, as the generated code is faster and more resource-efficient.
        </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Efficient parallelization and optimization of tasks can reduce latency in the application. This is particularly important for real-time applications such as games, where low latency is crucial for a smooth user experience.</p>
